Hi there! I am a PhD student in the [ISE department](https://ise.usc.edu/) at the University of Southern California advised by [Dr. Victoria Stodden](https://www.stodden.net/). 

My research focuses on developing metrics and tools that facilitate **transparent** and **verifiable** machine learning research, with an emphasis on promoting computational **reproducibility** through open code and data standards.

I am working on [ReproScreener](https://www.reproscreener.com), a tool to automate and enable the verification of computational reproducibility in machine learning at scale.
